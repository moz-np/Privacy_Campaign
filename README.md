# Student Leaders
Hello Student Leaders!! Use this Repo to keep track of your projects and objectives for the Privacy Campaign in respective colleges. Create issues by copying and pasting the templates below and filling in your information. It is not necessary to use the same template, but it is there for you to give a start if you are confused on what to do. 

You can think about this as a plan for what you want to accomplish over the next month (at least to begin).

### First thing First 
## It is wished that you complete the following tasks first.

1. Create a profile in ![mozillians.org](http://mozillians.org), after all you are a Mozillian.
2. Apply for ![Firefox Student Ambassadors](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/studentambassadors/).
3. Create a ![Firefox Club](https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors/FirefoxClubs) in your colleges. If you already have one then activate it, contact previous Club Leads to transfer the ownership/leadership to the current students.
4. Form a group of (4-5) friends who can support you the most for the campaign.

### Template for creating a new issue

Limit yourself to 2 and a maximum of 3 objectives for the next month. And each objective should have 3 or a maximum of 5 key results.

```
## Objective: 
[One line narrative, inspiring description of what you want to accomplish. Something you can rally yourself and possibly your team/community around.]
